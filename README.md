# Secret Sasquatch Society Inventory Manager
`aad_repo` contains the API definitions required for the inventory store management web application

## Workflow
Gitflow will be used to manage the project. There will be two branches within this repo; `master` and `develop`. Any features that is to be added to the repo should follow this flow:
```
master
    \develop
        \feature  # Feature branch has to be specific i.e. login-api, login-frontend
```

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.X
- Pip
- Virtualenv

## Setup
```
> virtualenv -p Python3 venv # 'venv' is just the name of the virtual environment
> source venv/bin/activate # this activates a virtual environment on linux/macos
> pip install -r requirements.txt # once virtualenv activated, run this command to install python libraries required  
```
> This setup is for local testing

## Testing
To run the pytests locally, enter the following command in a terminal:
```$xslt
> pytest --cov=[module]
```
To run a test coverage report, use this:
```$xslt
> pytest --cov=[module] --cov-report html
```
